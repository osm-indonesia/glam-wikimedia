Perkumpulan OpenStreetMap Indonesia (POI), in collaboration with Wikimedia Indonesia, creates an interactive mapping system aimed at inventory and visualizing historical places in order to support the GLAM Indonesia project through WikiData, Wikimedia Commons, and OpenStreetMap. This map is an initiative solution for marketing and promoting cultural and historical places by providing open access to information, providing accessibility information for people with disabilities, and allowing the community to contribute by mapping cultural and historical places in Indonesia. Additionally, the mapping system ultimately allows the community to assist the government in developing and improving people's interest in studying history and cultural diversity in Indonesia. The project places youth as the main actor of the project since they have great potential as a development resource with their critical, creative, and innovative thinking. This open-mapping platform aims to visualize and analyze historical maps with accessibility for people with disabilities, which is accessible and can be used by the public and government to enrich historical information.
